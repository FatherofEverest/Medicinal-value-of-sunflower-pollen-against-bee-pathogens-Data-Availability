#Data from J Leslie sunflower/buckwheat  crithidia microcolony experiment
#Microcolony	-- experimental unit of 5 adult bees
#Innoculationdate	-- date on which colony inoculated; corresponds to colony of origin
#Dateegg1 -- calendar date of egg laying	
#Time2egg	-- number of days after inoculation before first egg found
#Laideggs-- whether or not eggs were laid during the experiment	
#Eggbi	-- binary response , 0 = no egg, 1= laid egg
#Numbereggs--no data (number of eggs laid before dissection time 
#Infection: treatment with 2 levels, I=inoculated with Crithidia-containing gut extract, U=sham inoculated
#Pollen : pollen type that microcolonies were fed during experiment. B=buckwheat, S=sunflower
#use data from individual bees to calculate size dimorphism
